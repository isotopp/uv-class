  uv in context: migration and judgment

The final chapter places uv in the wider Python ecosystem.
It teaches comparison, trade-offs, and judgment, not tool worship.
Students learn when uv is enough and when additional tools are justified.

## Topics

- `uv` vs `pip` + `venv`
- `uv` vs `poetry`
- When `uv` is sufficient
- When other tools are needed
  - Native dependencies
  - Conda environments
  - Mixed-language toolchains
- Migration principles
- Avoiding tool cargo cults
